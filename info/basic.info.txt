Every app starts from idea, and from planing what app should do and how it should be used.
We need to white a few diagrams, and pictures what the main flows.

For app that collects feedback for apps - the main flow should be something like this.
User signs up via Google OAuth (sign with 'google' account) -> (Express, MongoDB, PassportJS)
User pays for email credits via stripe -> (Stripe + MongoDB)
User creates a new "campaign" -> (React + Redux)
User enters a list of emails to send question survey to -> (React + Redux + Redux Form)
App sends emails to list -> (Email Provider)
Surveyees clicks on links in email to provide feedback -> (Express, MongoDB, Email Provider)
App tabulate feedback -> (MongoDB ?)
User can see report of all survey responses. (React + Redux + MongoDB)

Architecture:
React App <-> Express API Server <-> MongoDB. Client doesn't talk to DB directly.
