Every app starts from idea, and from planing what app should do and how it should be used.
We need to white a few diagrams, and pictures what the main flows.

For app that collects feedback for apps - the main flow should be something like this.
User signs up via Google OAuth (sign with 'google' account) ->
User pays for email credits via stripe ->
User creates a new "campaign" ->
User enters a list of emails to send question survey to ->
App sends emails to list ->
Surveyees clicks on links in email to provide feedback ->
App tabulate feedback ->
User can see report of all survey responses.
